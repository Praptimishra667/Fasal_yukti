# 🌾 Fasal Yukti - Intelligent Crop Recommendation System

**Fasal Yukti** is a machine learning-powered crop recommendation system that suggests the most suitable crop for cultivation based on environmental and soil conditions. The project empowers farmers and agricultural decision-makers by providing scientifically-backed crop suggestions to boost yield and sustainability.

## 📌 Features

- 🔍 Predicts crops using key features like:
  - Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K)
  - Temperature, Humidity, pH, and Rainfall
- 🤖 Built using machine learning (Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier)
- 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and insightful visualizations
- 📈 Model evaluation and comparison with multiple algorithms
- 🧩 Easy to interpret results with real-world application relevance
- 📷 Includes screenshots and 🎥 demo videos for better understanding

## 🧠 Machine Learning Workflow

1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**
   - Cleaned and structured crop recommendation dataset
   - Handled missing values and outliers

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Plots for feature relationships and distribution
   - Correlation matrix and heatmaps

3. **Model Training & Evaluation**
   - Multiple classifiers tested: SVC, Decision Trees, Naive Bayes, etc.
   - Gaussian Naive Bayes delivered the highest accuracy

4. **Prediction**
   - Accepts new inputs for N, P, K, temperature, etc.
   - Predicts the most suitable crop for given conditions
